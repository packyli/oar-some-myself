Introduction

The project Oar-some Myself is a research on Feedforward Learning via a user study on VR rowing exergame activities.
The source code runs on Unity 2022.3.39f1 with Windows. We recommand to install the Unity Hub to manage the Unity version and then launch the project.
The VR exergame requires the connection with HMD Meta Quest Pro and Concept2 Rowing Machine.

Usage:
1. Launch the project Oar-some Myself via Unity 2022.3.39f1
2. Run the source code on Unity
3. For debug mode, no need to connect with Meta Quest Pro or Concept2 Rowing Machine
4. For play mode, connect your PC to Concept2 Rowing Machine via the cable and connect the PC to Meta Quest Pro (Might meed "reset view" on Meat Quest Pro)
5. Press the key 'S' to kick off the game (from Round 1, and ends with Round5)
6. For debug mode, press the key 'W' to row once; For play mode, conduct a stoke sitting on the Concept2 Rowing Machine to drive the boat in VR
7. Press the blank to trigger the next round once the previous round ends

   Notes: The exergame system will automatically generate the log files in the windows. (the directory can be found on the console while the exergame is running)
